# Cancer-predictive-model


This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess cancer risk based on various health, dietary, and demographic factors. We use a structured process to clean, preprocess, and model the data, applying advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers for feature extraction, to improve prediction accuracy.

Project Overview
This predictive model is structured to analyze various health and lifestyle data points to calculate the likelihood of cancer risk in individuals. The model integrates demographic, dietary, laboratory, and lifestyle data to create a robust predictive model, moving through each stage of data handling, feature engineering, and model training.

Dataset Information
The dataset consists of merged files covering:

Demographic Data: Participant details such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc.
Dietary Data: Information on nutrition and dietary habits.
Lab Results: Biomarker values including CRP and HbA1c levels.
Lifestyle Factors: General lifestyle and medical history.
Dataset Path: /content/merged_cancer_data.csv (or other format)

Project Workflow
The project follows a step-by-step procedure:

Data Acquisition & Initial Analysis: Load and inspect datasets, identify key features.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features, combining datasets to maximize predictive power.
Model Development:
First, a baseline model to identify impactful features.
Then, advanced models and optional transformer layers for prediction.
Evaluation & Validation: Assess model performance, using AUC-ROC, F1 score, and other metrics.
Deployment: Package the final model and prepare for deployment.
Installation and Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kiamaikocoders/predictive-cancer-risk-model.git
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment (for Colab users, mount Google Drive):
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Usage
Open the project notebook in Colab or Jupyter and follow the steps outlined to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
Run each code cell to progress through data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
Visualizations
Below are example visualizations to help understand the dataset and model results:

1. Data Distribution
A histogram of age and biomarker distributions, showing any skewness or outliers in the data.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example: Age Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['age'], kde=True)
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
2. Correlation Matrix
Shows the relationships between various numeric features, highlighting potential predictors.
python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
3. Model Performance
A ROC curve to visualize model performance.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

# Assuming y_test and y_pred_proba are defined
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
